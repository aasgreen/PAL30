{"name":"Pal30","tagline":"Studying the textures of PAL30 liquid crystals","body":"# PAL 30\r\n\r\nPAL 30 is a banana shaped liquid crystal. It sprang onto the scene with the publication of a paper titled \"Sequence of Four Orthogonal Smectic Phases in an Achiral Bent-Core Liquid Crystal: Evidence for the SmAP$_\\alpha$ Phase\". It is generally interesting as it forms chiral phases although the molecule itself is achiral and it also has a very rich phase diagram.\r\n\r\nI am looking at PAL30 to see if I can find evidence for or against the existence of the phase alluded to in the paper mentioned above: the SmAP$_\\alpha$ phase. From what I understand, this phase is characterized by the director of subsequent smectic layers being rotated by an angle $\\alpha$. For those of you not familiar with liquid crystal terminology, a smectic film is one where the material is arranged in discrete layers--like an oil-film on water--, and if you consider a banana shape \">\", it points in a specific direction. So, as you move \"up\" through the layers in the film, the direction of the banana molecules change direction by an angle $\\alpha$. \r\n\r\nThe specific evidence for the existence of this phase is still something I'm working through. I think it has to do with the IV curve (current vs voltage). As you apply a voltage you can force the bananas to rotate, and with some clever insights about the symmetry and polarization of the bananas you can determine the structure. I have yet to work through the detailed analysis of it though. \r\n\r\nBut there is some evidence from our group about this phase that is in conflict with the published results. I will be following up on these reports by looking at the PAL30 sample under thin films. Thin films make for a great tool to look at material structure, as I can use some basic ellipsometry and reflection microscopy to determine the birefringence. Or, more plainly, by looking at the optical properties of the material one can infer properties about the underlying structure.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
