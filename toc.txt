The investigation of PAL30
----------------------------

Intro/Overview: We had some initial problems with our first sample of
PAL30. It looked like it had been contanimated, there were bubbles in it
when it was heated to high temperature. We are currently trying to obtain
more PAL30.

In the meantime, I am trying to see the qualatative behaviour of PAL30 in
other materials. I have a SmC compound that I've been making thin films with.
We are hoping to see director transitions under an oscillating electric field.
However, I didn't see anything definitive.

Folders| Description
June10/June11 | These contain the data for the initial investigation
SmC| This contains the data from the experiments with SmC-- hoped to see director switching. Nothing conclusive.
PAL30 | Contains the data for several PAL runs. Seeing switching behaviour, and even odd things. No strong evidence for tilt however.
